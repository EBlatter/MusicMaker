# Critique - 12/2
## By Sisi Cheng

I got your program working (after the brief struggle in class) and tried it out! I tried inputting Ode To Joy and a few other tunes, and here are some feedbacks:

* Right now, it seems like the each cell in the spreadsheet is set to the duration of the shortest note in the song. It would be cumbersome to have to lengthen every note in the input just to be able to include a few eighth notes. Though as you work on supporting more features to vary the durations of notes, this may no longer be an issue. Or you may have to think of something to make this better.

* Even with some musical background, I still need the sheet music to create any song that's more complex. It's hard to intuit how many rows should be between two adjacent notes, and there's quite a bit of overhead to try out a note. It's kind of like trying to play a song by ear on the piano by hitting random keys.

* Ode To Joy worked out really well, since most of the adjacent notes are grouped close together. But inputting the program may still require some musical knowledge about where the half notes are. Maybe you'll also want to ask another user with less musical experience and see how easy it is for them.

* If you have the time, you may consider a way to smooth the user experience so the user can more quickly try notes to see if they sound right, or add some sort of marking to the Excel input interface to guide the user input.
