# Preliminary Evaluation
###What works well? What are you particularly pleased with?
So far, I have managed to implement changing the pitch and volume of a note. Though both can be a bit finicky, they're still functional and easy for the user to tweak and change to get the song just right. 


###What could be improved? For example, how could the user's experience be better? How might your implementation be simpler or more cohesive?
At this point, it is a bit difficult to see what needs to be changed to make the user's experience better as not all of the basic functionality has been created. I still have yet to implement the lengths of notes, so currently all notes have the same duration. However, implementing this seems to be  crucial to creating songs that actually sound like the songs they're supposed to be. I also need to implement some error handling to make it easier for people to use, as well as some tests to make sure everything is coded correctly. Also, I currently have the tempo set so the user can't change it to keep things simple, but I need to see how well that works for more sample songs once I implement duration for notes.


###Re-visit your evaluation plan from the beginning of the project. Which tools have you used to evaluate the quality of your design? What have you learned from these evaluations? Have you made any significant changes as a result of these tools, the critiques, or user tests?
So far, I have just talked to my critique group about my design ideas. They have been helpful for brainstorming and generating ideas for how I could improve my design. For example, my critique group suggested I switch from .rtf files to Excel spreadsheets, which has made things better and easier. I have not had a chance to do much user testing beyond asking my suitemates if my sample songs sound like they're supposed to, though the response is typically "Ehhhh? Kind of?", though I believe that's mostly due to the fact that I haven't implemented lengths of notes yet.


###Where did you run into trouble and why? For example, did you come up with some syntax that you found difficult to implement, given your host language choice? Did you want to support multiple features, but you had trouble getting them to play well together?
I had some trouble earlier with finding useful libraries for what I needed to do and figuring out how they worked. Many had poor documentation and I had trouble even figuring out how to install them. However, taking the time to find good libraries in my host language to implement with seems to have helped make the actual implementation easier. 

###What's left to accomplish before the end of the project?
* Implement variable length of notes
* Error handling
* Testing with potential users and seeing what minor tweaks need to be made
