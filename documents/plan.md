# Project plan

## Language evaluation

I will know that my language has accomplished its goals if the output matches expected output. I will be sure to write tests for my language, both for the parser and for the semantics, to ensure that everything is being interpreted and output correctly. Though I likely will not have time for this, I think user-testing could be useful to see how user-friendly it is and if it actually makes sense to potential users.


## Implementation plan

By November 16, I plan to have selected a host language selected and have a fully fleshed-out design and AST. The AST should be implemented by then.

By November 23, I plan to have the parser and semantics for changes in pitch implemented, as well as tests for it.

By December 1, I plan to have the parser and semantics for length of note implemented, as well as tests for it.

By December 12, I plan to have implemented my finishing touches. My language should be fully functional, including dynamics.
